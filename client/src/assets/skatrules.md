# Tournée Skat: How to Play

### Overview

Skat is a 3-handed, trick-taking card game from Germany.  In general, players bid against each other for the right to choose from a handful of different game types. Then, the player winning the bid plays against the other two, either winning or losing his declared game, and scoring positive or negative points accordingly. Each game is worth a different number of points, multiplied by a modifying "factor".

As with most trick-taking games, one must follow suit if possible, or play any other card if unable. Skat employs the concept of a trump suit, with the unusual feature that ALL Jacks also belong to the trump suit, and in fact are always the four highest trumps, in a set order (Clubs is the highest, followed by Spades, Hearts, and last Diamonds).

There are many variations on this old game; Tournee Skat is, as near as we can tell, not particularly well known, and rules for it are difficult to come by. This, of course, makes the document you are now reading rare and indispensable.

### The Deal

Skat uses a deck of 32 cards, a standard deck of playing cards with everything below a 7 removed. Each of the three players is dealt ten cards; this leaves 2 cards remaining. These two cards are referred to as "the Skat". and belong to no one at the time of the deal. They may become involved in the play of the hand depending on what type of game is played.

The standard order of dealing (much faster than dealing one card at a time) is to deal three cards to each player; then deal the Skat; then four cards to each; then three to each. In practice, the exact order does not matter, so long as the Skat is never dealt last. This protects against someone seeing the bottom of the deck and knowing one of the Skat cards, which would constitute a large unfair advantage.

### Game Type: Standard

##### Points

In a Standard game, one player has won the bidding against the other two, and declares a trump suit. The trump suit may be one of the four basic suits, in which case all four Jacks belong to the declared suit; or only Jacks may be trump, in which case Jacks constitute a fifth "suit" all to themselves; that is, if a Jack is led, a Jack must be played to follow suit.

The object of a standard game is to capture points by taking tricks. Cards in the Skat deck have inherent point values:

Ace: 11

Ten: 10

King: 4

Queen: 3

Jack: 2

Nine, Eight, Seven: 0

This adds up to 120 points in the whole deck. In a standard game, the winning bidder must capture 61 points (that is, more than half) in order to win the game and score positive points. One major source of confusion in beginning Skat players is that there are two types of points:

- Card points, which one must capture in order to successfully win the declared game
- Score points, the positive or negative points one accrues on the scoresheet from winning or losing the game

The value of card points captured does not directly appear in your score; rather, you must capture enough points (specifically, 61 of them) to win your game and achieve a positive score, the size of which is determined by what game you played and other factors detailed later.

##### Card Rank

The rank of cards in Skat is slightly unusual. As already noted, the four Jacks rank at the top of the trump suit (always C, S, H, D from high to low). Additionally, in all suits, the Ten ranks immediately below the Ace (in line with its point value). So the sequence of ranks in each suit is:
A, 10, K, Q, 9, 8, 7

Remembering the rank of the 10 is particularly critical, since they are worth so many card points.

##### Choosing Trumps

There are a few ways the winning bidder may determine the trump suit in Skat. The simplest is a **Solo**: the player simply names the desired trump suit. In a Solo, the two Skat cards do not come into play and are revealed to no one until the end of the hand; however, any card points contained in the Skat belong to the winning bidder and are counted in his total.

A **Grand** is simply a Solo in which only the Jacks are trumps - again, constituting a fifth "suit" to which only the four Jacks belong. We won't get into scoring just yet, but a Grand is generally the highest-scoring game.

A **Guetz** (pronounced "goots", also called "Guckser", German for "looker") is like a Grand, except that the winning bidder may pick up both Skat cards, add them to his hand, and then discard two cards into the Skat. Again, all points in the Skat belong to the winning bidder and are counted into his point total. This ability to adjust one's hand is very powerful, but it comes at a cost: if a Guetz is lost, the negative score is doubled. More on scoring later.

The last, and probably the most common, way to determine trumps is a **Turn**. In a Turn, the winning bidder is at the mercy of the Skat for determining the trump suit.

To begin a Turn, the winning bidder picks up just one of the Skat cards and looks at it, without showing it to the other players or adding it into his hand. The suit of this card is the candidate trump suit. The player now must make one of two choices:

- Reveal this card to all players, making its suit the trump suit; OR
- Reject this trump suit and immediately reveal the the other skat card to all players, making ITS suit the trump suit.

The first of these options is called a "single turn". the second a "double turn". In both cases, the winning bidder will have revealed one of the two skat cards to all players; he also takes both skat cards into his hand and discards two cards of his choice into the Skat. As in a Guetz, a player playing a "double turn" has his negative score doubled if he fails to win the game.

If a player turns a Jack from the Skat, he has the option to make the Jack's suit the trump suit, or to make Jacks the only trumps. The latter option is called a Tournée Grand.

##### Scoring

Each game is worth a different base point value, as follows:

|                   | Solo | Turn |
| :---------------- | ---- | ---- |
| **Clubs**         | 12   | 8    |
| **Spades**        | 11   | 7    |
| **Hearts**        | 10   | 6    |
| **Diamonds**      | 9    | 5    |
| **Grand** (Jacks) | 20   | 12   |
| **Guetz**         | --   | 16   |

This base value is then multiplied by a *factor*, calculated as follows:

- **Matadors**, a.k.a. "with or without". The primary determiner of the factor is how many consecutive trumps, from the Jack of Clubs down, the winning bidder either holds ("with") or does not hold ("without"). If the player has the Jack of Clubs,  he is "with" some number, found by counting down through the trumps until the first trump the player does not hold. For example, If he holds the Jack of Clubs and the Jack of Spades, but is missing the Jack of Hearts, he is "with 2". If he holds all four Jacks and the Ace and Ten of the trump suit, but is missing the King, he is "with 6".

  If the player is missing the Jack of Clubs, he is "without" some number, found in the same way, counting down through the trump suit until the first card the winning bidder does hold. If he is missing the Jack of Clubs, Jack of Spades, and Jack of Hearts, but holds the Jack of Diamonds, he is "without 3".

  Note that for purposes of calculating the factor, a player's hand includes the two cards in the Skat - even if he has not seen them during the play! This could either increase or decrease the factor unexpectedly.

- **Game**. An additional factor is always earned simply for winning the bidding and naming the game. When calculating the factor at the end of a hand, players will typically say "without 1, game 2" or "with 4, game 5".

- **Schneider and Schwarz**. A player must capture 61 card points to win the hand, but bonus factors may be earned for doing better. If a player captures 91 card points (more than 3/4 of the available points), he has made Schneider and receives an extra factor. "With 3, game 4, Schneider 5". If he captures all 10 tricks, he has made Schwarz and receives yet another extra factor. If he fails to capture 31 (more than 1/4) of the card points, then the defense has made Schneider and the player has an additional factor tacked on to his negative score.

  In games where the Skat is not used, Schneider and Schwarz may also be declared. This is worth an additional bonus factor for each declaration, but this is very rare, because the requirements for winning the hand become considerably more difficult - failure to reach the declared condition results in losing the entire hand. One should not declare Schneider or Schwarz unless one is absolutely certain of reaching it.

  There exists a special type of Grand called **Grand Overt**, which automatically includes declared Schneider and declared Schwarz. Additionally, it must be played with the winning bidder's hand face up. It is worth an incredible 24 points per factor. In over two decades of playing Skat, I have never seen this happen.

Note that a player always receives one factor for game, and is always either with or without at least 1. Therefore, 2 is the minimum factor, and the smallest standard game (a diamond turn, with or without 1) is worth 10 points.

### Null

A Null is quite different from a standard game. The object is simple: the bidder agrees to take zero tricks. In a Null hand, there are no card points, no factors, and no trumps - not even the Jacks. The cards return to their standard order - A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7. A null is worth a flat 20 points. A Null Overt is the same game, but the player bidding it turns his hand face-up before the opening lead. This is worth a flat 40 points.

### Ramsch

Ramsch, German for "junk", is a game played when no player wishes to risk negative points by declaring one of the above games. Like a Grand or Guetz, the Jacks are the only trumps, and the cards have the same point values as in a standard game. However, in a Ramsch, the object for each player is to take as few points as possible. The player capturing the fewest points earns 10 score points. If a player takes no tricks at all during the Ramsch, he earns 20 points. If.a player manages to capture every trick during the Ramsch, he gets -30 points.

The two cards in the Skat - and any points contained therein - go to the winner of the last trick of the Ramsch. The last trick often contains a large number of points - try not to take it!

If two players finish tied in a Ramsch, whichever of the two captured a trick most recently loses. In practice, sometimes it is difficult to remember the order of tricks; in this case, we usually agree to split the points, 5 to each of the tied players.

### The Bidding

The bidding process occurs at the beginning of every hand, in order to determine who has the right to name the game. Bidding competitively requires the ability to determine the value in score points of the game you intend to play - but often the bidding is not competitive. In the majority of hands, only one player has a hand worth bidding. The bidding process effectively plays out as a series of bidding competitions between two of the three players.

The player sitting to the left of the dealer becomes the "hold" hand. The player to his left, or the "middlehand", will act first in the bidding, beginning with some valid number of score points (generally 10) or passing if he does not have a hand he wishes to declare. The "hold" hand does not have to bid above the middlehand's bid; he may simply *match* the middlehand's bid by responding "yes", or he may pass. The middlehand may then increase his bid and repeat the process, or pass. If the middlehand passes, then the hold hand wins this round.

Next, the third player bids against the winner of the initial round in the same way. The third player must bid a number of points higher than that reached in the initial round of bidding; the winner of that initial round may respond "yes" or pass.

If both middlehand and third hand have passed, the "hold" hand may name any game he wishes, including Ramsch - in fact, this is the only way a Ramsch may be reached. Otherwise, the winner of the bidding may name any other game, keeping in mind that the score point value of the game he chooses must be equal to or higher than the bid he has reached. The final number bid is not relevant to the scoring, except that if the final bid is higher than the value of the actual game played, then the hand is lost.

A sample round of bidding is given below. Note that certain numbers are skipped because they do not represent valid score totals; there is no Skat hand that can score, for example, 11, 13, 17, or 19 points.

H = hold hand, M = middle hand, T = third hand  
M: Ten.  
H: Yes.  
M: Twelve.  
H: Yes.  
M:  Fourteen.  
H. Pass. (At this point the bidding between M and H is over, and now T and M bid.)  
T: Fifteen.  
M.  Yes.  
T: Sixteen.  
M: Yes.
T: Eighteen.
M: Yes.
T: Twenty.
M: Pass.  

Third hand has now won the bidding at 20 and may name any game he wishes (other than Ramsch), provided that the value of the game, after factors are included, is at least 20. Regardless of who wins the bidding, the hold hand always has the privilege of the opening lead.

### Keeping Score and Settling Up

As previously discussed, the score value of a hand is determined by the value of the chosen game, and in the case of a Standard game, multiplied by the factor. This value is added to the winning bidder's score if the hand is won, or subtracted if the hand is lost, subtracted doubly if the game is a double turn or a Guetz. Running totals are kept of each player's score, and play generally continues until a set time, at which point payment is settled.

Simply, each player pays each other player who has a higher score total the difference between their two scores, times a per-point rate which for our group is a quarter of a cent. So if player A scores 150 and player B scores 350, then A pays B 200 points * .25 cents = 50 cents. It is unheard of for a player to lose more than a few dollars at this rate.

### Final Notes

If this seems like a lot of rules, it is - but most players who are familiar with trick-taking games start to get the feel of the game fairly quickly. Once the rules make sense, the next things to begin understanding are:

- When is my hand good enough to bid?
- If the bidding is competitive, how high should I bid?
- How do I play my hand in order to maximize my chances to win the game I named?
- How do I work with another player to defend when someone else names the game?

Remember that everyone who plays Skat has climbed this learning curve - don't get discouraged by making mistakes, we've all made them (and still do from time to time). Be bold and have fun!
